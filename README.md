Arista Networking Inc was fouded on 9 May 2008 by Andy Bechtolshiem, David Cherion & Ken Duda. together the founders recognized a niche demand for cloud computing, datastorage, and focused on providing better infrastructure. It's IPO was a great successIPO generated $225million. accoring to **["Tracxn's Arista company profile"](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/arista/__eINI1p13BqjSVFKwatDVyYg3AKqmKuiXsYxPDDDbRr8#:~:text=Overall%2C%20Arista%20and%20its%20competitors,funding%20rounds%20involving%20208%20investors.)**:

    •   "Overall, Arista and its compettitors have raised over $1.71B in funding accross 101 funding rounds involing 208 invesstors"

## They do what? :thinking:

Arista is a major provider and developer of cloud computing, networking and Datacenter solutions.
Data center operators, cloud service providers and entities with large scale networking needs are Arista's main customer base. Arista has over 9000+ customers world wide. Its biggest competiters are some of the biggest names in the computing industry

Per Arista's White Paper titled, **["The Arista Advantage Cloud Networking Trends"](https://s21.q4cdn.com/861911615/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Arista_Advantage.pdf)**
"The world is rapidly moving to the cloud to achieve greater agility and economy, following the lead of the cloud titans.
Arista’s revolutionary innovations in data-driven cloud networking are propelling this dynamic transformation that
integrates private, public and hybrid clouds into a seamless network running a single operating system.
Modern applications including artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), social media, and big data, coupled
with emerging architectures that include dense server virtualization and IP Storage have placed enormous demands
on the network infrastructure in the Data Centers, Clouds, WANs and Workspaces.

Key transformations include:
    • Architectures are transforming the enterprise, extending to the campus and branch, converting siloed places in the network to a cloud-first strategy resulting in places in the cloud.

    • Application standards and methodologies are changing, requiring agility and elastic demand in order to meet business requirements.
    
    • Traffic patterns of the past are supplanted by highly distributed applications that drive east-west traffic for workloads, workflows, workstreams, and disparate devices.
    
    • The pressing mandate facing cloud-scale and enterprise providers to easily move between different workloads without compromising cycle time.
    
    • Data centers are moving to microservices that can be deployed physically, virtually, and in containerized models.

Clearly, the market demands in the networking arena have created a perfect storm for industry transformation."

## Technobabble

Just as the market demands, Arista truly provides:

    •   Arista was the first in the industry to deploy 25G Layer 1+ switching with optimized optic, for ultralow latency, and high density 25/100G L1 replication. 

    •   Arista CloudEOS dirctly links enterprise sites to Amazon AWS Cloud without the need for VPN tunneling.

## Happy Landscapes by Bob Ross

Arista is a major player in the Computer networking, data center solutions and cloud infrastructure
In the last 10 years, Network and cloud infrastructure has seen the birth of software-defined networking, network automation with the development of ultra-low latency, high-performance networks in data centers and cloud computing. Its largest competitors are:

    •   Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Huawaei, IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Google etc

## Results Matter, Who Knew

Arista has had a significant impact on the development of cloud computing and data-center markets.
Like most other networking and computing companies, revenue and market share, are the two core metrics for success.
    [Stock Analysis'](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/anet/revenue/) website states:

    "Arista Networks had revenue of $5.26B in the twelve months ending June 30, 2023, with 50.27% growth year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter ending June 30, 2023 was $1.46B with 38.70% year-over-year growth. In the year 2022, Arista Networks had annual revenue of $4.38B with 48.62% growth."

## Recommendations of a Plebe

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

 It is my solid recomendation thata Arista should develop technologies and software in Advanced Cybersecurity, AI & Machine learning as they pertain to networking and datacenters.

    •  Machine learning through observation can enable data center servers to build and implement robotics and software programs that can repair and diagnose themselves. 

    • AI Based Cybersecurity that can analyze and evolve as soon as a new app, threat or softeware enters the market. This would have huge governments and civilian applications.

    • AI reading imaging scans of X-rays, cat scans, MRI results can analyze each image down to a single pixle to recognaize abnormalities. In labrotories a sample of tisse and fluid can almost instantly name, each type and count for each cell, or organisms within the sample.

With these technologies,  Arista could expand with three new departmental branches. Which would bring in  more customers in a broader range of expanding Machine learning and artificial intellegence markets: robotics, cybersecurity and scientific applications. it would help them to remain competitive in the ever evolving world of technology.
